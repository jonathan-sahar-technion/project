#### RBP binding motifs - Tim Hughs catalog (mammalian only), later can incorporate CLIP data
* No. of motifs for proteins not involved in translation machinery
    - consider similarity to consensus
    - consider functional annotations (GO?)
     @consider separately - each of them
     @group by expression patterns of RBPs in our data (or other data), for example: all that are up in HS, down in HS etc.

#### K-mers
* per (existence/count of every) k-mer (k=6-10), get a pValue for differentiating the group containing the k-mer from a random control.

### To do
-----------
* fix SSH keys for git
* two way correlation of RBPs
* extract and enumerate k-mers

### Done
-----------
